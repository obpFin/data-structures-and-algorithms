# Rules for Binary search tree:
# 1. All child nodes in the tree right of the root node must be greater than the current node
# 2. All child nodes in the tree left of the root node must be less than the current node
# 3. Node should only have 2 children

# Pros:
# Better than O (n)
# Ordered
# Flexibe size

# Cons:
# No O (1) operations

# Lookup O (log N)
# insert O (log N)
# delete O (log N)
