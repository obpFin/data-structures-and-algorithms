// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search

// Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
// The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of
// a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

// In other words, the traversal goes from root level to as deep possible, until leaf node is found.
// From there it goes to parent node to check if there's another child for the node and continues the logic until the value is found. - obp
