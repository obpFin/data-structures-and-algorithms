// The 3 pillars of good code:

// 1. Readable
// 2. Time Complexity 
// 3. Space Complexity

// What skills interviewer is looking for:

// Analytic Skills - How can you think through problems and analyze things?
// Coding Skills - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code? 
// Technical knowledge - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for? 
// Communication skills: Does your personality match the companies’ culture?

// Good code checklist:

// ✅ It works
// ✅ Good use of data structures
// ✅ Code Re-use/ Do Not Repeat Yourself
// ✅ Modular - makes code more readable, maintainable and testable
// ✅ Less than O(N^2). We want to avoid nested loops if we can since they are expensive. Two separate loops are better than 2 nested loops
// ✅ Low Space Complexity --> Recursion can cause stack overflow, copying of large arrays may exceed memory of machine

// Heurestics to ace the question:

// ✅ Hash Maps are usually the answer to improve Time Complexity
// ✅ If it's a sorted array, use Binary tree to achieve O(log N). Divide and Conquer - Divide a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. Binary search is a great example of this
// ✅ Try Sorting your input
// ✅ Hash tables and precomputed information (i.e. sorted) are some of the best ways to optimize your code
// ✅ Look at the Time vs Space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra state in memory can help the time. (Runtime)
// ✅ If the interviewer is giving you advice/tips/hints. Follow them
// ✅ Space time tradeoffs: Hastables usually solve this a lot of the times. You use more space, but you can get a time optimization to the process. In programming, you often times can use up a little bit more space to get faster time
